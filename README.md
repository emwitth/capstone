# capstone-backend
This is the backend code for my capstone for a Software Engineering Graduate degree at University of Wisconsin Lacrosse.
It is to go along with the capstone frontend. If anybody finds my bad code useful. Feel free to use it, but make sure to credit me.
I will update this readme when there is more to say.
