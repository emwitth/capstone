# capstone-backend
This is the backend code for my capstone for a Software Engineering Graduate degree at University of Wisconsin Lacrosse.
It in conjunction with the [Frontend](https://github.com/emwitth/capstone-frontend).
This code is meant as a (relatively) portable application to be run on linux for network analysis named *Remora Fish*.

## running and packages
This project is written in python3 code and requires several packages to be installed:
 + scapy
 + flask
 + psutil (should be included with python3 automatically)
 + netifaces (should be included with python3 automatically)
